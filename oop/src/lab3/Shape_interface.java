package lab3;
// use for implement common behavior of non related classes: ex: animals and ppls can eat 

public interface Shape_interface {
	double getArea(); 
	double getPerimeter();
}
// when calss implements multiple behavior: ex: like duck will implement swimmable and flyable 


// use for abstract calss
// diff: abstract and non abstract methods 
//when u want provide common implementation like Area is in the circle and rect
//whne u want to provide a skelet class for game as example
